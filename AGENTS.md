# AI Agent advice for tsooyts

<https://agents.md>

## Purpose

Goal: Short guide for coding agents (auto-formatters, linters, CI bots, test runners, codegen agents) working on this Python project.

## Code Style

- Concise type annotations

## Agent behavior rules

- Always follow the project's formatting, linting, and typing configs.
- Make minimal, focused changes; prefer separate commits per concern.
- Add or update tests for any behavioral change.
- Include clear commit messages and PR descriptions.
- If uncertain about design, open an issue instead of making large changes.
- Respect branch protection: push to feature branches and create PRs.

## CI integration

- Format and lint in pre-commit job
- Run tests and dependency audit on PRs.

## Minimal example PR checklist

- Runs formatting and linting locally
- Adds/updates tests for changes
- Includes changelog entry if behavior changed
- Marks PR as draft if large refactor

## Code Coverage

- Aim for 100% coverage, but prioritize meaningful tests over simply hitting every line.

## Git Issues, Branches, Commits, and Pull Requests

All non-trivial work follows this lifecycle: **Issue -> Branch -> Commits ->
Pull Request**. Each step is described below with the concrete rules agents
must follow.

### Issues

Every piece of work starts with an issue. Issues answer the most expensive
question in code maintenance: *Why is this change being made?*

- An issue describes the observation, bug, feature request, or maintenance
  task that motivates the work.
- Do not begin coding without a corresponding issue (the only exception is a
  truly trivial fix that needs no explanation).

### Branches

All development happens on feature branches, never directly on `main`.

- **Naming convention**: `<ISSUE_NUMBER>-<CONCISE-TITLE>`
  - The concise title is derived from the issue title, using lowercase words
    separated by hyphens.
  - Example: for issue #42 titled "Add timeout to LDAP queries", the branch
    name is `42-add-ldap-timeout`.
- Create the branch from the current `main`:
  `git checkout -b <branch-name> main`
- Push with tracking: `git push -u origin <branch-name>`

### Commits

Write commit messages following the
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) style with the
issue number included.

**Format:**

```text
<PREFIX> #<ISSUE_NUMBER> concise subject line

Optional body with additional context.
Agent: <agent name> (<model name>)
```

**Prefix values** (use the one that best describes the change):

| Prefix | Use for |
|--------|---------|
| `feat` | New feature or capability |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring, no behavior change |
| `style` | Formatting, linting, whitespace |
| `maint` | Maintenance, dependency updates, housekeeping |
| `ci` | CI/CD configuration |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests |

**Examples:**

```text
feat #42 add configurable timeout to LDAP queries

Default timeout is 30 s; configurable via dm_config.ini.
Agent: OpenCode (claudeopus46)
```

```text
docs #15 update AGENTS.md with branching workflow
```

### Pull Requests

A Pull Request (PR) describes *how* an issue has been (or will be) addressed.

- Every PR should reference at least one issue.
- Use a bullet list at the top of the PR body to link related issues:

  ```md
  - closes #42
  - #15
  ```

  Using `closes #N` will auto-close the issue when the PR is merged.
- The PR title should be a concise summary of the change.
- PR discussion comments should explain the approach, trade-offs, and any
  open questions.
